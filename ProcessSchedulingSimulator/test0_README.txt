Note: This file contains SEVERAL TEST FILES you may want to use while
      developing the simulator. Before using this file split it 
      MANUALLY into the corresponding test files and remove all text 
      leaving only the numbers.

In the coming days another file, test1.txt, will be made 
available in the Web and you should use that file to produce the results
you submit with your report. This file will start with a row of numbers
followed by an empty line, and so on. It will terminate with an empty
line.
